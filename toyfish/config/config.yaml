  # The reference genome should be in fasta format. Under the current version, we recommend reference genome 
  # to be approximately at chromosome level. In other words, we advice against a highly fragmented reference genome
  # (e.g. L80 > 100). Due to the fact that many downstream analyses are performed at chromosome/scaffold/contig level,
  # having a highly-fragmented reference genome will create too many parallel jobs and might put cluster in high stress.
